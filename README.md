cuda_goap
=========

GOAP planner that runs on CUDA devices with compute capability 2.0+

We have implemented GOAP - Goal Oriented Action Planning ( http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html ) on the GPU.
It works well, ie. outperforms a CPU implementation of the same code
when the number of agents and players it has to deal with is more than 10,000.

This is my masters project at Newcastle University U.K 2014, Computer Games Engineering.

The repo includes all the code plus, the visua studio (2010) files. 

Requires that you have the CUDA 5.5 SDK installed on your computer.
